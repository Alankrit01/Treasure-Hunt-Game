# Treasure-Hunt-Game
Simple Treasure Hunt Game involving a Hunter, Monsters, Obstacles and Treasures

The game always starts in the setup stage. During that stage the user is shown the grid and can place four different types of objects on the cells of the grid:
-> by clicking on a cell and typing a number between 1 and 9, a treasure is placed on that cell, the number indicates the value of the treasure;
-> by clicking on a cell and typing the letter "h", the treasure hunter is placed on that cell;
-> by clicking on a cell and typing the letter "m", a monster is placed on that cell;
-> by clicking on a cell and typing the letter "o", an obstacle is placed on that cell.

The game ends if one of the following conditions becomes true:
-> the user ends the game;
-> the treasure hunter is killed;
-> there are no treasures still on the grid;
-> neither the treasure hunter nor any of the monsters is able to move.
